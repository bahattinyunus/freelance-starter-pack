# 🚀 DOMINION: PROJECTS
### *Tactical Execution Hub & Operational Frameworks*

The **Projects Dominion** is the operational engine of your freelance enterprise. It contains active architectures and the standard protocols required to deliver world-class software and products on time, every time.

## 🛰️ PROJECT CATALOG

| Project | Strategic Role | Operational Tech |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`landing-admin`** | Rapid deployment of client administration systems. | HTML, CSS, JS |
| **`public-api`** | Standardized gateway for digital service integration. | Python, Node |
| **`task-manager`** | Internal command center for sprint execution. | Python, SQLite |

## 📋 STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOPs)

To maintain 'Zenith' quality, every project must pass through these tactical phases:

### Phase 1: Deep Discovery (Intel Gathering)
- Define the "Ideal Project Outcome" for the client.
- Identify all technical and business constraints.
- Create an initial `PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md` in the project root.

### Phase 2: Rapid Sprint Cycles
- Use the `task-manager` to track daily milestones.
- Commit code at high frequency to ensure transparency.
- Automate repetitive tasks using the `Nexus Tool` (`_SCRIPTS/`).

### Phase 3: The Hardening Phase
- Peer review (or AI-audit) all core logic.
- Optimize for performance and signal-to-noise ratio in code.
- Finalize documentation for handoff.

### Phase 4: Tactical Handoff
- Deliver a comprehensive "Operational Manual" to the client.
- Conduct a closing strategy session to identify future value-add opportunities.

## 🛠️ OPERATIONAL TOOLS
Use the scripts in `_SCRIPTS/` to automate common project tasks like directory setup, git initialization, and automated testing.

## 📈 STRATEGIC FOCUS
Professionalism is found in the *process*, not just the *product*. By following these SOPs, you move from "freelance coder" to "elite engineering partner."
