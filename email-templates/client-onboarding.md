# Client Onboarding Email Templates

## Template 1: Welcome Email

**Subject:** Welcome Aboard! / Project Kickoff: [Project Name]

Hi [Client Name],

I'm really excited to get started on [Project Name]!

To kick things off, I've attached the following documents:
1.  **Signed Agreement**: For your records.
2.  **Invoice #001**: For the initial deposit.
3.  **Project Timeline**: An overview of our key milestones.

**Next Steps:**
- Please review and sign the agreement (if you haven't already).
- Process the deposit invoice.
- [Any other immediate action item, e.g., "Send over the logo files"].

Once the deposit is received, I'll schedule our kickoff call to dive into the details.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,

[Your Name]
