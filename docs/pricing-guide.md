# Freelance Pricing Guide

Pricing your services correctly is one of the hardest parts of freelancing. Here are a few common models to consider.

## 1. Hourly Rate
**Best for:** Unclear scope, ongoing maintenance, consulting.
**Pros:** You get paid for every hour you work.
**Cons:** Punishes efficiency (the faster you work, the less you earn). Clients may micromanage hours.

**Formula:**
`(Desired Annual Income + Expenses) / Billable Hours = Hourly Rate`

## 2. Fixed Project Fee
**Best for:** Well-defined projects (e.g., "Build a 5-page website").
**Pros:** Rewards efficiency. Clients know the exact cost upfront.
**Cons:** Scope creep can kill your profitability.

**Tip:** Always add a buffer (10-20%) for unexpected issues.

## 3. Retainer
**Best for:** Long-term relationships, ongoing services (e.g., social media management, SEO).
**Pros:** Predictable income.
**Cons:** Can be hard to sell to new clients.

## 4. Value-Based Pricing
**Best for:** High-impact projects where your work directly drives revenue.
**Pros:** Highest earning potential.
**Cons:** Requires strong sales skills and trust.

**Concept:** Price based on the *value* you provide to the client, not the time it takes you. If your work will make them $100k, charging $10k is a no-brainer, even if it only takes you 5 hours.

## General Tips
- **Never underprice:** It attracts bad clients and leads to burnout.
- **Raise your rates:** Review your rates every 6-12 months.
- **Get a deposit:** Always ask for 50% upfront for fixed projects.
