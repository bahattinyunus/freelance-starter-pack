## 🏁 OPERATIONAL DRILLS

### The 'Rapid Deployment' Sequence
When starting a new client project, follow this drill to ensure consistency:
1.  **Initialize:** Run `nexus_tool.py init [project_name]` to create the 'Zenith' structure.
2.  **Asset Load:** Deploy templates from `DOMINION_TEMPLATES/` to the new project root.
3.  **Git Sync:** Use the script to initialize a local git instance and connect it to a remote node.

## 🚀 USAGE PROTOCOLS

1.  **Environment Isolation:** Recommended to use `venv/` for all script operations.
2.  **The 'Dry Run' Rule:** Always run scripts with a `--dry-run` flag (if available) before committing changes to production files.
3.  **Refactoring Guidelines:** When adding new scripts, maintain the 'Obsidian' style of logging and error handling.
