## 🏁 HIGH-CONVERSION CHECKLISTS

### Outreach & Emails
- [ ] **Personalized Hook:** Mention a specific detail about the client's current situation.
- [ ] **Authority Jump:** Briefly mention a similar problem you've solved.
- [ ] **Frictionless CTA:** Ask for a 15-minute 'Quick Strategy' call, not a 'Meeting.'

### Proposals & Bids
- [ ] **The 'Why' Section:** Clearly articulate why this project matters to the client's bottom line.

### Contracts & Legals

## 💰 THE PRICING MASTERY & FRAMING GUIDE
How you present your price is as important as the price itself. Use these framing techniques in your proposals.

1.  **Investment, Not Cost:** Always refer to your fee as an "Investment."
2.  **The Anchor Effect:** Present your highest-tier 'Elite' package first to anchor the price high.
3.  **Tear-Sheet Pricing:** Provide a breakdown of value, not hours. "Strategic Consultation" is worth more than "Working for 2 hours."
4.  **The 'Why Now' Incentive:** Offer a small implementation bonus for contracts signed within 48 hours to create ethical urgency.

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL
1.  **Never Use Base Files:** Always duplicate a template into your client's specific project directory.
2.  **Strategic Customization:** Tailor every proposal to the specific pain points of the prospect.
3.  **Regular Audits:** Update your templates based on new legal trends and conversion data.
