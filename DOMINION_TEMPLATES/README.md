## 🏁 HIGH-CONVERSION CHECKLISTS

### Outreach & Emails
- [ ] **Personalized Hook:** Mention a specific detail about the client's current situation.
- [ ] **Authority Jump:** Briefly mention a similar problem you've solved.
- [ ] **Frictionless CTA:** Ask for a 15-minute 'Quick Strategy' call, not a 'Meeting.'

### Proposals & Bids
- [ ] **The 'Why' Section:** Clearly articulate why this project matters to the client's bottom line.
- [ ] **Tiered Pricing:** Offer 3 options (e.g., Essential, Standard, Elite) to frame the value.
- [ ] **The Roadmap:** Provide a clear timeline with defined milestones.

### Contracts & Legals
- [ ] **Scope Lock:** Define exactly what is included (and excluded) to prevent scope creep.
- [ ] **Payment Terms:** Standardize upfront deposits (e.g., 50% upfront).
- [ ] **Kill-Fee Clause:** Protect yourself against sudden project cancellations.

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL
1.  **Never Use Base Files:** Always duplicate a template into your client's specific project directory.
2.  **Strategic Customization:** Tailor every proposal to the specific pain points of the prospect.
3.  **Regular Audits:** Update your templates based on new legal trends and conversion data.
