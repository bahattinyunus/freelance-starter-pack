# 🛠️ DOMINION: TEMPLATES
### *Strategic Assets for Business Sovereignty*

The **Templates Dominion** provides the legal and professional infrastructure required to run a world-class freelance operation. These are battle-tested documents designed for high conversion and legal clarity.

## 🛰️ ASSET CATEGORIES

- **`contracts/`**: Professional service agreements ensuring mutual protection.
- **`email/`**: High-conversion outreach and client follow-up sequences.
- **`invoices/`**: Clean, premium billing templates.
- **`proposals/`**: Tactical project bids designed to win high-ticket clients.

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

1.  **Duplicate:** Never edit the base templates directly. Always create a copy for each new client/project.
2.  **Customize:** Replace all bracketed information `[DATE, CLIENT NAME, etc.]` with accurate project data.
3.  **Validate:** Ensure all legal terms in contracts align with your local jurisdiction.

## 📈 STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE

Standardized assets reduce cognitive load and professionalize your client's experience from day one. Move from "freelancer" to "strategic partner" with these assets.
